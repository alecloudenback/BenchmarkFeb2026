# BenchmarkJan2026
Python, Go, and Rust code for comparing execution time.

Each implementation is split into 3 files:
- functions: functions to read rate files, produce a collection of rates for a specific case, run an illustration, and solve for a premium
- parallel: architecture to run multiple cases over multiple workers using a queue or queue-like system
- main: primary entry point for benchmarking both an illustration simulation and a premium solve simulation

## Python
Enter "python" subdirectory and run main.py for run time results, e.g.
```
python main.py
```
Adjust N and W in main.py to adjust cases and # of parallel processes.

## Go
Enter "go" subdirectory and run main.go for benchmarking results
```
go run .
```
Adjust numTasks and numWorkers in main.go to adjust cases and # of parallel processes.

To build an executable use this command instead:
```
go build .
```

Exe that is generated by ```go build .``` can be successfully run in the "go" subdirectory it is generated in. Relative references are used which may cause the exe to fail in other locations.

## Rust
Enter "rust" subdirectory and run using cargo

For running in debug mode (faster compilation, slower execution):
```
cargo run .
```
For running release (slower compilation, faster execution)
```
cargo run --release .
```

The exe that is generated by ```cargo run --release .``` must be exected from the "rust" subdirectory due to relative references in the code otherwise it will fail.
